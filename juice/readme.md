# The juicy stuff!

This is the web app for this project. It's kind of simple, viewing a slide of a presentation where you can:

1. Draw figures (or what you want) on the slide
2. Comment the slide in a text (wysiwyg) editor

[Feel free to try the demo here](http://breakfast.antontibblin.se/)

## Known issues

- Drawings are note scalable; they are absolute to the screen resolution when it was made...

## Todo

Right now all the data is saved locally (localStorage) on your device. It will be saved on a server connected to your account.
